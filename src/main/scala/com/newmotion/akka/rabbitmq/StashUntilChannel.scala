 * The StashUntilChannel trait makes an actor have a RabbitMQ channel set up with the setupChannel method which should
 * be provided in the actor implementation.
 * The actor can be used immediately. While the channel setup is in progress, incoming messages will be queued and they
 * will be processed by the time the channel is set up.
 *
 * The actor behavior in a StashUntilChannel instance must be defined in the receiveWithChannel method instead of the
 * receive method.
